So, I'm starting this new projetct, a blog to post articles about game development and architecture. Thus I need a web site to post it. The first option would be to use Medium. But I'm a web developer, so I need to try to create my onw!

After 2 days fighting with CSS I reach a very simple grid template with a markDown parser to help the writting.

And everything was *almost* responsive, at least I tried to make it so.

Another important thing, english is not my main language, so maybe I gonna write wrong some things.

I will comeback latter to talk a little more about the company and the ideas behind it, but for now this is the first post ever :)
