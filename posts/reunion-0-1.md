Yesterday (01/05/2022) we made our first reunion, sadly with only two of us personally and one via Google Meet. But even in this situation, we did a lot of progress.

-   We choose a font: Robot for the body of every text (Maybe try Open Sans in the future).
-   We tried some palette colors 
-   Improve the overall CSS structure with new variables

## Choosing Fonts
To choose the font we made some kind of display of the possible options. Between the options was:

- Mukto
- Inconsolata
- Open Sans
- Roboto
- Nunito

We ended up with Roboto, just because the time was running out. Maybe I will test some Open Sans in the future


## Trying Palettes

It was a lot of fun and we are excited to improve each time more this website and write new and improved articles here.

  
Between the pallets tested we have these:

I liked the gray one. But will try nome others in the future, thus it's nothing defined yet. Maybe a bluer grey. 

  

To improve the palette swap I created many variables to centralize the styles of the website. In the future, I want to make a Dark Theme as well, but to do this will need to make some changes again. 

  

And to document the moment, we decided to shoot some photos *(and I made some effects by hand)*:
