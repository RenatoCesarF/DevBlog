{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"new-blog-features","content":"\r\n\r\nAdd code highlight, and it's preaty cool! Like That:\r\n```python\r\ndef preaty_cool_python_function(cool_param):\r\n    if(not cool_param):\r\n        return\r\n    print(cool_param)\r\n```\r\n\r\nit has many themes and options.\r\n\r\nAll posts are writen in MarkDown files, so it's possible to choose a language in every code-section. And also choose a highlight theme for the post using the configuration header\r\n\r\n\r\nStill need to add more themes (load each one from the package into a external file), but I think that it's a good idea after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it bring some problems, for no reason each post (even the shortests ones like this) take almost 2 seconds to load. I think it's something about the new method of MarkDown parse that I'm using. Need to test it out.\r\n\r\nAfter this session I will publish this \"website\" thus I can show for people easily\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nAnother cool thing is that, if I didn't add cover image for the post, it will generate one. For now it still just an `<h1>`, but i will create more diversed things in the future.
